jarvis
======

Just A Really Very Idiotic Shell - version 0.1.0

jarvis is for me, not you (at least at the moment). If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, hurry along and pay it no heed.

...Still want to run it? Okay. You will need the latest [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads) installed. Then just do `nw jarvis/`.
