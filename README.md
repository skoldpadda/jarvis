**Just A Really Very Idiotic Shell** -- version 0.1.0

jarvis is for me, not you (at least at the moment). If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, hurry along and pay it no heed.

...Still want to use it? Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.

## Installing

See the [installation guide](docs/installation-guide.md).

## Using

Made it this far? Awesome. Now run that bad boy.

```bash
strap
```

At this point you can visit `localhost:4000` to see an in-browser reference implementation of the jarvis client.

## Developing

For more about the project's goals and design, see the [spec](docs/spec.md).

## Todo

See the [Issues](https://github.com/willyg302/jarvis/issues) for a list of relevant todo items, as well as everything marked [`@TODO`](https://github.com/willyg302/jarvis/search?q=%22%40TODO%22) in any source file.
